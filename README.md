# TikTok Claims Classification Project

This project showcases my data analysis and Python skills, completed during the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.

## Project Overview:

**Note:**
- This project uses a fictional scenario and synthetic data created for educational purposes.

This project simulates a real-world scenario faced by TikTok, where a growing volume of user-flagged claims overwhelms their moderation team. The goal was to develop a machine learning model to automatically classify content containing claims, enabling:
- **Reduced Backlog:** Streamlining the review process by identifying claims upfront.
- **Prioritization:** Helping moderators focus on flagged content requiring immediate attention.

### Technical Skills:
- **Project Management:** Defined project milestones and deliverables.
- **Python:** Utilized libraries for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
- **Data Wrangling:** Transformed unstructured data into a clean, structured dataset.
- **Data Analysis:** Gathered descriptive statistics and visualized the data.
- **Communication:** Delivered an executive summary to stakeholders.

## Project Steps

1. **Course 1: Project Proposal**
   - Created a [proposal](TikTok%20project%20proposal.docx) outlining the project plan and milestones.

2. **Course 2: Data Wrangling**
   - Built a pandas DataFrame for the provided CSV dataset.
   - Cleaned and manipulated the data using Python libraries.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics.
   - Visualized the data using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).
   - Delivered an executive summary to simulate communication with stakeholders.
   - **Resources:**

     - [Dataset (CSV)](tiktok_dataset.csv)
     - [Executive summary](TikTok%20Course%202%20executive%20summary.pptx)
   
3. **Course 3: EDA and Visualizations**
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
     Conducted EDA on data for the claims classification project.
   - **Data Visualizations:**
     Created data visualizations using Tableau.
   - **Summary of EDA Results:**
     Provided a summary of the results of exploratory data analysis.
   - **Resources:**
     - [Jupyter notebook](Course%203%20TikTok%20project%20lab.ipynb)
     - [Tableau dashboard](TikTok%20End%20of%20Course%20Project%20-%20Course%203.twbx)
     - [Executive summary](TikTok%20Course%203%20executive%20summary.pptx)
     
4. **Course 4: Updates**
   **Course 4 TikTok Project Lab:**
   - Computed descriptive statistics.
   - Conducted a hypothesis test.
   **Course 4 Executive Summary:**
   - Stated the statistical test results clearly.
   - Identified recommended next steps in order to build a predictive model.
   - **Resources:**
     - [Jupyter notebook](Course%204%20TikTok%20project%20lab.ipynb)
     - [Executive summary](TikTok%20Course%204%20executive%20summary.pptx)

This document will be updated throughout the course as I learn more.
