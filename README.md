# TikTok Claims Classification Project

This project showcases my data analysis and Python skills, completed during the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.

## Project Overview:

**Note:**
- This project uses a fictional scenario and synthetic data created for educational purposes.

This project simulates a real-world scenario faced by TikTok, where a growing volume of user-flagged claims overwhelms their moderation team. The goal was to develop a machine learning model to automatically classify content containing claims, enabling:
- **Reduced Backlog:** Streamlining the review process by identifying claims upfront.
- **Prioritization:** Helping moderators focus on flagged content requiring immediate attention.

### Technical Skills:
- **Project Management:** Defined project milestones and deliverables.
- **Python:** Utilized libraries for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
- **Data Wrangling:** Transformed unstructured data into a clean, structured dataset.
- **Data Analysis:** Gathered descriptive statistics and visualized the data.
- **Communication:** Delivered an executive summary to stakeholders.

## Project Steps:
1. **[Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CWzDRu6KWCmuuZJxfii0Y5o9DrVspr_DHbEchIzs6e8/edit?usp=sharing):** Created a proposal outlining the project plan and milestones.
2. **Data Wrangling:**
   - Built a pandas DataFrame for the provided CSV dataset.
   - Cleaned and manipulated the data using Python libraries.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics.
   - Visualized the data using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn).
